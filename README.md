# TreeConnect
This repository contains a simple Keras implementation of the TreeConnect architecture presented in the corresponding paper "TreeConnect: A Sparse Alternative to Fully Connected Layers" published at the International Conference on Tools with Artificial Inteligence 2018. The code allows to reproduce the results presented on CIFAR10 using a CNN feature extractor (refer to the paper for details).

## Requirements

- Keras with Tensorflow backend
- Numpy
